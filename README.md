## Project Overview:

This project detects the gender of a person in real-time using computer vision and deep learning.
It uses a trained CNN-based model integrated with OpenCV for face detection and classification.

The system can process:

1. Webcam feed
2. Images
3. Video files

### Technologies Used:
  
1. Python
2. OpenCV
3. TensorFlow / Keras
4. NumPy

### How It Works:
  
1. Face detection using OpenCV
2. Preprocessing (resize, normalization)
3. Gender prediction using trained CNN model
4. Display result with bounding box

### How to run:

1. Run requirements.txt on terminal
2. Run gender-detection-webcam.py

### Key Learning Outcomes:


	•	Model training using CNN
	•	Image preprocessing
	•	Real-time inference
	•	Integration of ML model with OpenCV
